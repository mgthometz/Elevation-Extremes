# Elevation-Extremes
In this project, I used Python to create a web-scraping tool to parse data for each country's highest and lowest point and then used Tableau to create a geographic visualization of the elevation spans.  The visualization can be found [here]( https://public.tableau.com/profile/matthew.thometz#!/).
